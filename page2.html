        <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;The emergence of AI has raised new ethical questions about its
          implications for human-centered values concerning privacy, autonomy,
          and fairness. In particular, many have questioned whether AI can
          become creative, how we would use this artificial intelligence
          humanely if it does become sentient, what happens if AI replaces
          humans in the workplace, and who’s responsible for AI’s mistakes?
          These questions call for further consideration into the philosophical
          and ethical ramifications of the recent emergence of AI and what the
          future holds for humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;In order to understand the ethical implications of AI, it is
          imperative to consider both its potential pros and cons. On one hand,
          AI could offer various advantages such as increased efficiency in
          decision-making processes, improved accuracy in diagnosing medical
          problems, better personalized experiences through data-driven
          services, and faster production speeds in manufacturing processes. On
          the other hand, as Zuboff notes in her article “Big Other:
          Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information
          Civilization” there are also numerous valid concerns about AI being
          used to monitor and control populations through algorithms that are
          discriminatory or biased (Zuboff 2019). This emphasizes the need to
          consider privacy rights, particularly when personal data is collected
          without consent or when individuals are not informed about how their
          data will be used. Furthermore, there is potential for AI to infringe
          on human autonomy by limiting choices due to the complexity and
          vagueness of these algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;There is also another form of AI bias we must take into account,
          how biased input data can lead AI to make repetitive mistakes and who
          should we accountable for these mistakes. In a recent class I took
          called Data Modeling: Plagues and epidemics, we looked into AI bias of
          mapping past criminal activities in Chicago to predict potential
          future areas of similar activity. The problem is that it was derived
          from past police reports, leading the AI algorithm to initially
          correctly believe that only places in which past reports took place
          were where future crimes were likely to occur. However, this caused
          various precincts to send more officers to patrol these areas leading
          to more crimes reported, causing a continuous positive feedback loop
          in which the AI after a few months was making crucial incorrect
          predictions, as it began to ignore other districts entirely. This is
          known as a positive feedback loop and can lead to huge problems in the
          field of data science, an area of research that is highly correlated
          with how machines currently learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;In addition to these ethical considerations, it is also
          important to consider philosophical questions about the nature of
          creativity and sentience when discussing AI. Many researchers have
          argued that creativity is an essential characteristic of human beings
          that cannot be replicated by machines (Willams 2019). Others suggest
          that creativity is an emergent property that arises from certain
          patterns or combinations of inputs (Gertz 2018). There has been much
          debate over whether AI can ever reach the level of creativity
          associated with humans or whether creativity should even be seen as a
          desirable trait for machines to possess. Additionally, there has been
          much discussion about what would happen if AI were to become sentient.
          According to Bostrom in his article “The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant”
          sentience implies moral responsibility which means that we must treat
          machines with a certain degree of respect (Bostrom 2004). This raises
          further questions about how we would use AI humanely if it were to
          become capable of experiencing emotions or feeling pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;I personally agree with Gertz’s stance and believe that
          creativity can be boiled down to the idea of connecting vastly distant
          and differing fields of thought, otherwise believed to be entirely
          unrelated, and create something not only unique but deemed socially
          constructive. A great example of such a definition is the creation of
          snowboarding. Prior to its creation most people would deem skiing and
          surfing entirely separate and different sporting events that couldn’t
          be combined. However, this is exactly what the creator of snowboarders
          thought of the idea, he made a connection between to entirely
          different fields, and the result has now become engrained in alpine
          sports. On the topic of whether I believe AI can become creative,
          certainly! If I managed to trick you earlier with the chatGPT essay, I
          would say that certainly helps argue my view. Currently Ais such as
          chatGPT use statistics and probability models incorporating
          NLP(natural language processing) theory to generate responses to users
          prompts. But what many recent researchers in the community are
          suggesting could lead to the next level of ‘creative’ AI are the idea
          of GAN(generative adversarial networks).
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Generative adversarial networks offer an avenue for Ais to have
          a real chance of developing truly creative ideas from the perspective
          of the modern human. To simplify the process, imagine the process
          behind the various ai generated photos you may have heard of. Now
          imagine there are two AIs: a generator which creates new instances of
          an object, in this instance a photo, and a discriminator which aims to
          determine if the generated object is real or created by an AI. It is
          typically stated in discussions surrounding GANs that one agent’s gain
          is another agent’s loss in the mathematics part. This is because if
          the generator fails to trick the discriminator, it then learns why and
          alters it generation procedures. The same logic applies to the
          discriminator. The question is if this process could be applied to the
          generation of new, creative ideas? Consider a network in which every
          idea, concept, or object representing a node, and their connection
          being a combination of those nodes representations. Expand that
          network via to include multi nodal connections such that in our
          previous example the connection of snowboarding might potentially
          represent a connection between entertainment, surfing, and skiing.
          This process stems purely from my own thought experiment, but I
          believe it holds the merit and demands further exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;From a theological perspective, there are also important
          implications for how we think about our relationship with technology.
          Ancient cultures often viewed different forms of technology as tools
          for achieving specific goals rather than sources of power themselves
          (Powell & Buchanan 2013). As Powell and Buchanan argue in their
          article “Breaking Evolution’s Chains: The Promise of Enhancement by
          Design” this view should inform our approach to technological
          advancement today (2013). They suggest that emerging technologies
          should be seen as enablers rather than replacements for human
          capabilities because they can help us transcend our physical
          limitations while still respecting our basic humanity. AI certainly
          has the potential to be viewed as a tool for helping humanity achieve
          its goals, but this thought becomes muddy when when consider from the
          ethical viewpoint of what if the AIs in question are sentient?
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Given all these considerations, it is clear that a
          philosophically informed interdisciplinary approach is needed for a
          more human centered ethical application of emerging technologies such
          as AI. Such an approach must take into account ancient world views
          about technology as well as modern ethical theories like
          utilitarianism which emphasizes promoting the greatest good for the
          greatest number of people (Bostrum 2005). It must also account for
          rights-based theories which focus on protecting individual rights such
          as privacy and autonomy (Vridling 2020) as well as virtue ethics which
          emphasize developing character traits like compassion and empathy
          (Hacking 2019). By taking all these factors into account we can ensure
          that emerging technologies are used in ways that promote human freedom
          and flourishing while still respecting basic human values like
          creativity and sentience.

        <h2>Interesting ChatGPT Prompts and Responses</h2>
        <h3>Prompt 1: Using chatGPT essay</h3>
        <p>
          Please take into account all public written works of professor Dr.
          Stephen Hudson (of Boston College) you have access to for the
          following question: If Dr. Stephen Hudson was reviewing this work,
          using his works as a basis, what are some counterpoints or critiques
          he might theoretically have for the following essay:
        </p>
        <h3>Response 1:</h3>
        <p>
          One critique that Dr. Hudson might have is that the essay does not
          fully explore the complexity of defining creativity, which is a key
          question in AI ethics. Dr. Hudson has argued that creativity is not a
          simple concept and that there are different forms of creativity that
          need to be considered when evaluating AI's ability to be creative. He
          has also cautioned against assuming that AI-generated outputs are
          necessarily creative, as there is a risk of conflating novelty with
          creativity. Another critique that Dr. Hudson might have is that the
          essay does not fully address the issue of accountability in the case
          of AI mistakes in the workplace. Dr. Hudson has written about the
          challenges of holding AI accountable for its actions and has suggested
          that a more nuanced approach is needed that takes into account the
          broader social and cultural context in which AI is being used. Dr.
          Hudson might also argue that the essay could benefit from a more
          in-depth examination of the historical and cultural factors that shape
          our understanding of AI and its ethical implications. He has written
          extensively on the role of cultural narratives in shaping our
          attitudes towards technology and has argued that a more critical
          examination of these narratives is needed to develop a more nuanced
          and ethically informed approach to AI. Finally, Dr. Hudson
          mightcritique the essay for not fully addressing the issue of power
          and control in AI development and use. He has argued that the ethical
          implications of AI are closely linked to questions of power and
          control and that it is important to consider who has the power to
          shape AI development and use and who is most likely to benefit from
          it. Without addressing these issues, he argues, it will be difficult
          to develop ethical guidelines for AI development and use that truly
          prioritize human-centered values.
        </p>
        <h3>Prompt 2:Using chatGPT essay</h3>
        <p>
          Do you have any critiques or counterpoints for the following essay
        </p>
        <h3>Response 2:</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, the essay provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration
          of the ethical implications of AI and its impact on human-centered
          values. The essay covers important ethical questions, including the
          potential for AI to replace humans in the workplace, the issue of AI
          bias, and the question of whether AI can become creative. The essay
          also draws on the ideas of several authors to support its argument and
          takes a philosophically informed interdisciplinary approach to the
          topic. One minor suggestion is to provide more specific examples to
          support the points made in the essay. For instance, when discussing AI
          bias, it would be helpful to provide specific examples of AI systems
          that have perpetuated existing biases and discrimination. Similarly,
          when discussing the potential for AI to replace humans in the
          workplace, specific examples of industries and jobs that are at risk
          of being replaced by AI would make the argument more concrete.
          Overall, the essay is well-organized and effectively communicates its
          key arguments. It is a thought-provoking and insightful exploration of
          a complex and important topic.

          This website! As a major in CS who has quite a bit of front-end
          experience (which is the how website look/ User interface of website
          design not the data manipulation/storage side) I have to say this
          website is created horribly. But for it to be able to do this in 15
          seconds is rather impressive. I really tried to make as little changes
          as possible and instead kept prompting chatgpt to refine the
          html/javascript/css files via promtping it. But i could not get it to
          create tabs/enter characters on its own so manually implemented it
          because my papers/points would be incredibly difficult otherwise. But
          considering that was the only alterations i made I'm rather impressed.
          Obviouslly chatGPT could not host the website so I did so myself.
          Afterwards, out of curiosity, I asked it as if I did not know: "Using
          gitHub services how would I host a website comprised of an html, css,
          and javascript files". To its credit is provided me with the proper
          methods steps and detailed instructions on how a new user could go
          about the process.
